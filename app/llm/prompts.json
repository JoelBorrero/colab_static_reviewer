Return for Branch A + Branch B = 3\n\n# fibonacci_recursive(5) returns 3 (high redundant calculations, time complexity O(2^n))\n```\n\n### Memoized Approach\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci_memoized(n, memo={}):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using a memoized recursive approach.\n\n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence.\n    memo (dict): A dictionary used to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The nth Fibonacci number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input should be a positive integer.\")\n\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n\n    if n == 1:\n        memo[n] = 0\n    elif n == 2:\n        memo[n] = 1\n    else:\n        memo[n] = fibonacci_memoized(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci_memoized(n - 2, memo)\n\n    return memo[n]\n\n# Breaking down Fibonacci(5):\n# 1. fibonacci_memoized(5)\n#    - `memo` is initially empty\n#    - branch A: fibonacci_memoized(4)\n#      - Not in memo, recurse: \n#        - branch AA: fibonacci_memoized(3)\n#          - Not in memo, recurse: \n#            - branch AAA: fibonacci_memoized(2) = 1 (store in memo)\n#            - branch AAB: fibonacci_memoized(1) = 0 (store in memo)\n#            - AAA + AAB = 1 + 0 = 1 (store in memo)\n#        - branch AB: fibonacci_memoized(2) = 1 (read from memo)\n#        - branch A totals = 1 + 1 = 2 (store in memo)\n#    - branch B: fibonacci_memoized(3) = 1 (read from memo)\n#    - Total for branches A and B = 2 + 1 = 3 (store in memo)\n# 2. Return 3 (fast calculation due to storing and reading from memo, time complexity O(n))\n\n# fibonacci_memoized(5) returns 3 (optimized with minimal redundant calculations)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Optimization\n\n- **Recursive Approach**: \n  - This method has exponential time complexity O(2^n) because the function makes many overlapping subproblems. For Fibonacci(5), it was necessary to recalculate the same numbers (such as Fibonacci(3) and Fibonacci(2)) multiple times.\n\n- **Memoized Approach**:\n  - This method significantly optimizes the recursion by storing each computed Fibonacci number in a dictionary (`memo`). Once a Fibonacci number is computed, it is reused instead of being recalculated, reducing the time complexity to O(n).\n  - For Fibonacci(5), because memoization avoids redundant calculations, the algorithm is much faster. Each Fibonacci number from 1 to 5 is calculated exactly once and stored in the dictionary.\n\nThis breakdown effectively illustrates how memoization improves the recursive Fibonacci implementation by reducing the number of calculations and the recursive stack depth.",
        "MODEL_B_RESPONSE": "Certainly! Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how Fibonacci calculations differ between a naive recursive approach and a memoized approach, with comments explaining the process. This example will help illustrate the differences in performance and how memoization optimizes the calculation.\n\n### Recursive Approach\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci_recursive(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Naive recursive approach to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.\n    This method employs simple recursion without any optimization.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base cases: the first two Fibonacci numbers.\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0  # F(1) = 0\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1  # F(2) = 1\n    else:\n        # Recursive case: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\n        # This method results in a lot of redundant calculations.\n        return fibonacci_recursive(n - 1) + fibonacci_recursive(n - 2)\n\n# Example call:\n# Calculating fibonacci_recursive(5) performs the following calculations:\n# F(5) => F(4) + F(3)\n#      => (F(3) + F(2)) + (F(2) + F(1))\n#      => ((F(2) + F(1)) + F(2)) + (F(2) + F(1))\n# This results in multiple recalculations of the same Fibonacci numbers.\n```\n\n### Memoized Approach\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci_memoized(n, memo=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursive approach to calculate the nth Fibonacci number with memoization.\n    This uses a dictionary to store previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the memo dictionary on the first call.\n    if memo is None:\n        memo = {}\n\n    # Check if the value is already computed.\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n\n    # Base cases: the first two Fibonacci numbers.\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0  # F(1) = 0\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1  # F(2) = 1\n    else:\n        # Recursive case with memoization:\n        # Check if F(n-1) and F(n-2) are already computed, otherwise calculate and store them.\n        memo[n] = fibonacci_memoized(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci_memoized(n - 2, memo)\n        return memo[n]\n\n# Example call:\n# Calculating fibonacci_memoized(5) performs the following calculations:\n# F(5) => F(4) + F(3)\n# F(4) is calculated and stored as (F(3) + F(2))\n# F(3) is calculated and stored as (F(2) + F(1))\n# As F(2) and F(1) are base cases, they are quickly resolved.\n# Once a Fibonacci number is calculated, subsequent calls use the stored result.\n# No redundant calculations occur once a number is stored.\n```\n\n### Key Differences and Performance Insights\n\n1. **Redundant Calculations**:\n   - In the recursive approach, each call recalculates Fibonacci numbers multiple times. This leads to a rapidly increasing number of function calls as `n` grows, especially for higher Fibonacci numbers where the same calculations are repeated many times.\n\n2. **Memoization Optimization**:\n   - By storing the results of each Fibonacci number calculation in a memo dictionary, the memoized approach avoids redundant calculations.\n   - Each Fibonacci number is calculated only once and stored for future reference, leading to linear time complexity.\n\n3. **Performance**:\n   - **Naive Recursive**: O(2^n) time complexity due to redundant calculations; it recalculates values for every possibility.\n   - **Memoized**: O(n) time complexity since each Fibonacci number is calculated once and stored.\n\n4. **Memory Usage**:\n   - Both approaches use O(n) space complexity for the call stack (recursive depth) in the naive approach and the memo dictionary in the memoized approach.\n\nUsing the memoized approach significantly optimizes performance for calculating Fibonacci numbers, especially as the input size grows. This highlights a practical application of memoization in dynamic programming to enhance efficiency.",

I am particularly interested in approaches that would make it easier to identify potential bottlenecks during CI/CD processes.",
        "MODEL_A_RESPONSE": "Improving meta-language documentation for a connection manager with an eye towards automating testing and enhancing continuous integration (CI/CD) pipelines can significantly streamline the development and deployment processes. Here are several strategies to achieve this:\n\n1. **Structured Documentation Formats**:\n   - **Markdown with PlantUML**: Use Markdown for text documentation and PlantUML for visual diagrams (like class diagrams or sequence diagrams) to illustrate the architecture and flow. This makes it easier to understand the connections and dependencies within the system.\n   - **Sphinx or Read the Docs**: Use Sphinx to generate high-quality documentation from Markdown and reStructuredText. Tools like Read the Docs can host this documentation, making it accessible to all team members.\n\n2. **Code Comments and Annotations**:\n   - **Detailed Docstrings**: Write comprehensive docstrings for functions, classes, and modules that include parameters, return types, and any edge cases. This aids in understanding the functionality without having to dive into the code.\n   - **Type Annotations**: Use PEP 484 type annotations to clearly specify data types, making the code self-documenting and aiding static analysis tools that can catch type-related issues early.\n\n3. **Testing Documentation**:\n   - **Test Descriptions and Scenarios**: Document each test with a brief description and the scenarios it covers. This helps in understanding the purpose of the test and the expected outcomes.\n   - **Test Setup and Environment**: Clearly outline the setup required to run tests, including dependencies, versions, and any environmental configurations. This can prevent issues during CI/CD runs by ensuring that the testing environment is consistently configured.\n\n4. **CI/CD Pipeline Documentation**:\n   - **Pipeline Stages and Steps**: Document each stage and step of the CI/CD pipeline, detailing what happens at each stage and why. This helps new team members understand how the pipeline works and where they can make changes.\n   - **Error Handling and Troubleshooting**: Include information on common errors encountered during CI/CD runs and how to troubleshoot them. This can reduce downtime and speed up resolution.\n\n5. **Performance Considerations**:\n   - **Performance Metrics and Benchmarks**: Document any performance metrics or benchmarks collected during testing. This helps in identifying potential bottlenecks and tracking improvements over time.\n   - **Resource Usage**: Provide information on the expected resource usage of the connection manager, such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. This can be crucial for capacity planning and optimization.\n\n6. **Automated Testing Frameworks**:\n   - **Unit Testing**: Use frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest` to create automated unit tests that cover the functionality of the connection manager. Document the test cases and the logic behind them.\n   - **Integration and End-to-End Testing**: Implement integration and end-to-end tests to validate the entire system. Document these tests to ensure they cover critical paths and edge cases.\n\n7. **Continuous Learning and Feedback**:\n   - **Review and Feedback Loop**: Establish a regular review process for documentation to ensure it remains up-to-date and accurate. Encourage team members to provide feedback and contribute to documentation improvements.\n   - **Automated Documentation Generation**: Use tools like Sphinx, Doxygen, or Pydocstyle to automate documentation generation and enforce consistency.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can create comprehensive, well-structured documentation that supports automated testing and enhances CI/CD pipelines. This not only makes the development process more efficient but also improves the overall maintainability and reliability of the connection manager.",
        "MODEL_B_RESPONSE": "Improving the meta-language documentation of your connection manager to support automated testing and CI/CD pipelines involves several strategies. These strategies aim to make the documentation clear, comprehensive, and actionable, allowing automated systems and developers to efficiently identify and address potential bottlenecks. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Structured Documentation:**\n   - **Adopt a Standard Format**: Use a standardized documentation format like Markdown or reStructuredText, which can be easily parsed and integrated into CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI.\n   - **Organize by Use Case**: Structure the documentation around common use cases, scenarios, and workflows that the connection manager is designed to handle. This helps testers understand typical paths through the system.\n   - **Detailed API Description**: Provide comprehensive API documentation, including input/output specifications, edge cases, and error handling, to facilitate the creation of automated tests.\n\n2. **Code Annotations:**\n   - **Inline Code Comments**: Use inline comments to explain complex code logic or sections where bottlenecks might occur. This helps automated code review tools to parse relevant information.\n   - **Annotations for Testing**: Use annotations to identify which parts of the code are critical to performance, require extensive testing, or are known to have issues. \n\n3. **Performance Metrics Documentation:**\n   - **Document Assumptions and Constraints**: Clearly state any assumptions about the environment or constraints of the connection manager. This supports the CI/CD pipeline in setting up relevant test environments.\n   - **Expected Performance Benchmarks**: Provide performance benchmarks and expected outcomes for typical operations. Automated tests can then compare current performance against these benchmarks to identify regressions.\n\n4. **Integration with Testing Frameworks:**\n   - **Link to Test Cases and Coverage Reports**: Integrate documentation with test case results and code coverage reports. This can be done through CI tools that automatically update documentation with test results.\n   - **Automation Scripts**: Include scripts or examples in the documentation for running automated tests, making it easier for developers to integrate these into their CI/CD pipelines.\n\n5. **Continuous Feedback Loop:**\n   - **Automated Documentation Generation**: Use tools like Sphinx (for Python) or Javadoc (for Java) to automatically generate and update documentation based on code changes.\n   - **Documentation Checks in CI/CD**: Integrate checks into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that documentation is kept up-to-date with code changes, using tools like Doxygen or DocFX for consistency checks.\n\n6. **Versioning and Change Logs:**\n   - **Version Documentation**: Keep track of changes in each version of the connection manager. Use semantic versioning and maintain a change log to help understand what modifications might affect performance or stability.\n   - **Deprecation Notices**: Clearly document deprecated features and their alternatives, so automated tests can adjust to avoid deprecated functionality.\n\n7. **Feedback Mechanisms:**\n   - **Encourage Feedback**: Provide a mechanism within the documentation for developers and testers to leave feedback or report issues, which can help identify frequently encountered bottlenecks.\n   - **Iterative Improvement**: Use feedback from automated testing to iteratively improve documentation clarity and comprehensiveness.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, the meta-language documentation can become a powerful tool in supporting automated testing and CI/CD processes. This not only improves the efficiency of identifying bottlenecks but also enhances the overall reliability and maintainability of the connection manager.",

Could you help me implement a Python function that tracks click-through rates and time spent on menu items, then generates a heatmap of user engagement?",
        "MODEL_A_RESPONSE": "Creating a Python function to track click-through rates and time spent on menu items, and then generate a heatmap, involves several steps. We will need to:\n\n1. Collect user interaction data, including clicks and time spent on each menu item.\n2. Calculate click-through rates and time metrics.\n3. Visualize the data using a heatmap.\n\nFor this example, I'll use a simple data structure to store user interactions. We'll then use the `pandas` library for data manipulation and `matplotlib` with `seaborn` for visualization.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Example data structure to store user interactions\nuser_interactions = [\n    {'user_id': 'user1', 'menu_item': 'Burger', 'action': 'click', 'time_spent': 30},\n    {'user_id': 'user2', 'menu_item': 'Burger', 'action': 'click', 'time_spent': 45},\n    {'user_id': 'user1', 'menu_item': 'Fries', 'action': 'view', 'time_spent': 10},\n    {'user_id': 'user2', 'menu_item': 'Fries', 'action': 'click', 'time_spent': 50},\n    {'user_id': 'user3', 'menu_item': 'Pizza', 'action': 'click', 'time_spent': 60},\n    # Add more entries as needed\n]\n\n# Convert the list to a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(user_interactions)\n\n# Calculate click-through rates\ndf['is_click'] = df['action'] == 'click'\nctr = df.groupby('menu_item')['is_click'].mean().reset_index()\nctr.rename(columns={'is_click': 'click_through_rate'}, inplace=True)\n\n# Calculate average time spent on each menu item\ntime_spent = df.groupby('menu_item')['time_spent'].mean().reset_index()\n\n# Combine CTR and average time spent into a single DataFrame\nengagement_data = pd.merge(ctr, time_spent, on='menu_item')\n\n# Create a heatmap using Seaborn\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.heatmap(engagement_data, annot=True, fmt=\".2f\", cmap='YlGnBu', linewidths=0.5)\nplt.title('User Engagement Heatmap')\nplt.xlabel('Metric')\nplt.ylabel('Menu Item')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: We define a list of dictionaries to represent user interactions. Each dictionary contains details about a user's interaction with a menu item, such as action type and time spent.\n\n2. **Data Manipulation**:\n   - Convert the list to a `pandas` DataFrame.\n   - Create a new column `is_click` to indicate whether the action was a click.\n   - Calculate the click-through rate (CTR) by grouping by `menu_item` and averaging the `is_click` column.\n   - Calculate the average time spent on each menu item.\n\n3. **Data Visualization**:\n   - Merge the CTR and average time spent DataFrames.\n   - Use `seaborn` to create a heatmap that visualizes the CTR and average time spent for each menu item.\n\nThis setup can be expanded by including more sophisticated data collection and processing mechanisms, such as real-time tracking or integrating with a database.",

In a real application, you would collect data from actual user interactions.\n- You can customize the heatmap's appearance by adjusting the colormap and other parameters.\n- Ensure you handle edge cases, such as a division by zero when calculating metrics, as demonstrated in the code.",

        "MODEL_A_RESPONSE": "Creating a function to validate and escape user-generated content for email templates is a crucial step in preventing XSS attacks. In Python, the `html` module provides functions that can help with escaping HTML content, and you can use regular expressions to identify potentially dangerous patterns.\n\nHere's a Python function that validates and escapes user-generated HTML content:\n\n```python\nimport html\nimport re\n\ndef sanitize_html(content):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sanitize HTML content to prevent XSS attacks.\n    \n    Args:\n        content (str): The HTML content to sanitize.\n        \n    Returns:\n        str: Sanitized HTML content.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Basic HTML escaping\n    sanitized = html.escape(content, quote=True)\n    \n    # Allow certain HTML tags\n    allowed_tags = re.compile(r'<(a|b|br|em|i|strong|ul|li|p|img|span)(.*?)>(.*?)</\\1>', re.IGNORECASE)\n    sanitized = allowed_tags.sub(lambda m: html.escape(m.group(0), quote=True), sanitized)\n    \n    # Allow certain HTML attributes\n    allowed_attributes = re.compile(r'[\\s]+[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:\\.\\-]*=[\\'\"]', re.IGNORECASE)\n    sanitized = allowed_attributes.sub('', sanitized)\n    \n    # Remove any JavaScript code\n    javascript_regex = re.compile(r'<script.*?</script>', re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)\n    sanitized = javascript_regex.sub('', sanitized)\n    \n    # Remove any on* attributes\n    on_attributes_regex = re.compile(r'<[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:\\.\\-]*\\s+on[a-zA-Z]+\\s*=\\s*[\\'\"]', re.IGNORECASE)\n    sanitized = on_attributes_regex.sub('', sanitized)\n    \n    # Remove any style attributes\n    style_attributes_regex = re.compile(r'<[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:\\.\\-]*\\s+style\\s*=\\s*[\\'\"]', re.IGNORECASE)\n    sanitized = style_attributes_regex.sub('', sanitized)\n    \n    # Remove any event attributes from links\n    link_event_attributes_regex = re.compile(r'<a.*?on.*?</a>', re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)\n    sanitized = link_event_attributes_regex.sub('', sanitized)\n    \n    # Remove any event attributes from images\n    image_event_attributes_regex = re.compile(r'<img.*?on.*?</img>', re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)\n    sanitized = image_event_attributes_regex.sub('', sanitized)\n    \n    return sanitized\n\n# Example usage:\nuser_input = \"<script>alert('XSS')</script> <a href='javascript:alert(\\\"XSS\\\")'>Click me</a>\"\nsanitized_content = sanitize_html(user_input)\nprint(sanitized_content)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Basic HTML Escaping**: The `html.escape` function escapes characters like `&`, `<`, `>`, `\"`, and `'` to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML.\n\n2. **Whitelisting Tags**: Only specific tags (`a`, `b`, `br`, etc.) are allowed, and they are whitelisted by checking their structure and ensuring they are correctly closed.\n\n3. **Removing Attributes**: All attributes are removed to prevent malicious ones. In a more complex scenario, you could whitelist specific attributes.\n\n4. **Removing JavaScript and Events**: The function removes any `<script>` tags, `on*` attributes, and similar constructs that can be used for injection.\n\n5. **Specific Tag Checks**: It includes additional checks for links and images, which are common targets for XSS attacks.\n\nThis function provides a starting point, but it might not cover all possible XSS vectors. It's essential to test and update your sanitization logic regularly to address emerging threats. Additionally, consider integrating with a specialized HTML sanitization library for more comprehensive protection.",
        "MODEL_B_RESPONSE": "Certainly! When dealing with user-generated content in your email templates, it's crucial to sanitize the input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks. Here’s a Python function that uses some common techniques to validate and escape user input for use in HTML email templates.\n\nThis function will:\n\n1. Escape HTML special characters to prevent HTML injection.\n2. Remove potentially dangerous attributes like `on*` (e.g., `onclick`, `onerror`) that can be used for script execution.\n3. Sanitize any script or style tags that could inject code.\n\nWe'll make use of Python's `html` library for escaping, and a regular expression to filter out unwanted patterns.\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom html import escape\n\ndef sanitize_html(input_string):\n    # Step 1: Escape HTML special characters\n    escaped_str = escape(input_string)\n\n    # Step 2: Remove potentially dangerous script elements and attributes\n    # Remove <script> and <style> tags\n    escaped_str = re.sub(r'<script[^>]*>(.*?)</script>', '', escaped_str, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    escaped_str = re.sub(r'<style[^>]*>(.*?)</style>', '', escaped_str, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n\n    # Remove event handler attributes (e.g., onclick, onerror)\n    escaped_str = re.sub(r'on\\w+=\"[^\"]*\"', '', escaped_str, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    escaped_str = re.sub(r'on\\w+=\\'[^\\']*\\'', '', escaped_str, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    \n    # Step 3: Remove javascript: links\n    escaped_str = re.sub(r'javascript:[^\"]*', '', escaped_str, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    escaped_str = re.sub(r'javascript:[^\\']*', '', escaped_str, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n\n    # Step 4: Remove data URIs in harmful contexts\n    escaped_str = re.sub(r'data:[^\"]*', '', escaped_str, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    escaped_str = re.sub(r'data:[^\\']*', '', escaped_str, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n\n    return escaped_str\n\n# Example usage:\nuser_input = '<a href=\"javascript:alert(\\'XSS\\')\" onclick=\"alert(\\'XSS\\')\">Click me!</a>'\nsafe_content = sanitize_html(user_input)\nprint(safe_content)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Escaping HTML:** This prevents raw HTML from being interpreted by the browser.\n- **Regex Filtering:** Regular expressions are used to identify and remove harmful patterns like script tags, event attributes, and potentially dangerous protocols.\n- **Avoiding Over-sanitization:** The function avoids being too restrictive, which might otherwise remove benign custom HTML.\n\n### Disclaimer:\nThis script provides a basic level of sanitization. For production environments, consider using more robust HTML sanitization libraries such as `Bleach`, which offers more comprehensive sanitization and is regularly updated for security.",

        "USER_PROMPT": "I need to implement a Python function that analyzes test coverage for GDPR-sensitive data processing functions, specifically tracking which personal data fields are accessed and how they're handled throughout the test suite. Can you help me create this compliance tracking system?",
        "MODEL_A_RESPONSE": "Creating a Python function to track the coverage of GDPR-sensitive data processing functions involves several steps. The goal is to analyze your test suite to ensure that all critical data fields are appropriately accessed and handled. This can be achieved using a combination of static code analysis, instrumentation, and runtime monitoring.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide and some sample code to get you started:\n\n1. **Define Sensitive Data Fields:**\n   Start by listing all personal data fields that are GDPR-sensitive in your application. These might include names, addresses, emails, etc.\n\n2. **Instrument Your Code:**\n   Use decorators or custom context managers to instrument your functions. This will help track when and how sensitive data fields are accessed.\n\n3. **Implement a Coverage Tracking System:**\n   Use a simple data structure to track which fields have been accessed and processed during testing.\n\n4. **Analyze the Test Suite:**\n   Run your test suite with the instrumentation in place and gather data on field accesses.\n\n5. **Report Coverage:**\n   Generate a report that details which fields were accessed, how many times, and in which functions.\n\nHere's a basic implementation:\n\n```python\nimport functools\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Define sensitive data fields\nSENSITIVE_FIELDS = ['name', 'email', 'address', 'date_of_birth']\n\n# Track field accesses\nfield_accesses = defaultdict(int)\n\ndef track_sensitive_data(func):\n    @functools.wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        # Iterate through sensitive fields and track accesses\n        for field in SENSITIVE_FIELDS:\n            if field in kwargs:\n                field_accesses[field] += 1\n            # Check if field is in a passed argument list (assuming simple case)\n            for arg in args:\n                if isinstance(arg, dict) and field in arg:\n                    field_accesses[field] += 1\n        \n        # Call the original function\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        return result\n    \n    return wrapper\n\n# Example sensitive data processing function\n@track_sensitive_data\ndef process_user_data(user_data):\n    # Simulate processing sensitive fields\n    print(f\"Processing name: {user_data.get('name')}\")\n    print(f\"Processing email: {user_data.get('email')}\")\n\n# Example usage\nuser_data = {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com', 'address': '123 Main St'}\nprocess_user_data(user_data)\n\n# Generate and print the coverage report\nprint(\"\nSensitive Data Coverage Report:\")\nfor field, access_count in field_accesses.items():\n    print(f\"{field}: {access_count} times\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Decorator Usage:** The `track_sensitive_data` decorator is applied to functions that process sensitive data. It inspects function arguments to count accesses.\n- **Data Structure:** `defaultdict` is used to store access counts for each sensitive field.\n- **Simplicity:** This implementation assumes simple function arguments (dictionaries). For more complex data structures, you may need to recursively check for sensitive fields.\n- **Scalability:** This solution is a starting point and may need to be expanded with more sophisticated analysis techniques for comprehensive coverage tracking in real-world applications.\n\nConsider using existing tools like `coverage.py` and `PyCodeQuality` for more comprehensive test coverage analysis. Additionally, explore libraries like `bandit` or `snyk` for security-specific code analysis.",
        "MODEL_B_RESPONSE": "Implementing a test coverage analysis system for tracking GDPR-sensitive data processing in Python involves several steps. The goal is to identify personal data fields being accessed and understand how they are handled in your testing suite. This involves two main tasks: identifying personal data usage in code, and mapping this usage through testing. Here’s a potential approach:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Personal Data\n\nFirst, you need a way to identify where and how personal data is used in your code. This involves scanning through your codebase and looking for common patterns or keywords that might indicate personal data use. Let's assume you have identifiers like `email`, `name`, `address`, etc.\n\n### Step 2: Create Decorators/Context Managers\n\nCreate Python decorators or context managers to tag functions or methods that handle GDPR-sensitive data. This way, when these functions are tested, you can automatically log coverage for these fields.\n\n```python\nimport functools\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(filename='gdpr_compliance.log', level=logging.INFO)\n\ndef gdpr_sensitive(fields):\n    \"\"\"Decorator to mark functions that process GDPR-sensitive fields.\"\"\"\n    def decorator(func):\n        @functools.wraps(func)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            logging.info(f\"Processing fields: {fields} in function {func.__name__}\")\n            result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n            logging.info(f\"Finished processing in function {func.__name__}\")\n            return result\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n```\n\n### Step 3: Annotate Your Code\n\nApply the `@gdpr_sensitive` decorator to all functions in your application that handle personal data.\n\n```python\n@gdpr_sensitive(['email', 'name'])\ndef process_user_data(user):\n    # Implementation that involves GDPR sensitive data\n    pass\n```\n\n### Step 4: Track Data Handling in Tests\n\nEnsure your test suite calls the decorated functions. The decorator will automatically log information about data handling when the test cases are executed.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze Coverage\n\nCreate a script to parse the log file to understand which fields are accessed and ensure all relevant data access is covered by tests.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_coverage(log_path):\n    coverage_map = {}\n    with open(log_path, 'r') as log_file:\n        for line in log_file:\n            if line.startswith('Processing fields'):\n                func_info, fields_info = line.split(': Function ')\n                fields_info = fields_info.split(' with fields ')[-1]\n                for field in fields_info.split(', '):\n                    coverage_map.setdefault(field, set()).add(func_info.split()[-1])\n\n    for field, functions in coverage_map.items():\n        print(f\"Field '{field}' is accessed in functions: {', '.join(functions)}\")\n\n# Example usage\nanalyze_coverage('gdpr_compliance.log')\n```\n\n### Considerations\n\n1. **Extensions for Type Checking:** Integrate static analysis tools like MyPy or Pytype for better introspection regarding types and function signatures. They can help identify personal data types more precisely.\n   \n2. **Integration with CI/CD:** Analyze coverage as a step in your CI/CD pipeline to continuously track test coverage of personal data usage.\n\n3. **Documentation & Auditing:** Ensure that results from the logs are documented comprehensively and can be presented as part of a GDPR compliance audit.\n\n4. **Security:** Be careful with how logs are stored and protected to avoid inadvertently exposing sensitive data.\n\nThis template helps establish a foundation but remember that GDPR compliance is multidisciplinary. Involve legal teams to ensure all data processing operations comply with GDPR mandates.",
